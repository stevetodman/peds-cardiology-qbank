# Pediatric Cardiology QBank Prompt Pack

This project hosts a production-ready prompt pack for building a 5,000-item pediatric cardiology multiple-choice question bank. The site replaces the original quiz interface with a single-page reference hub that contains the workflow overview, copy-ready prompts, JSON schema, blueprint tables, reviewer packets, and quality checklists.

## Getting started

1. Open `index.html` in your browser to load the prompt pack experience.
2. Follow the "Quick Start Workflow" section on the page to see the recommended four-step process.
3. Use the sticky navigation and built-in section search (press `/`) to jump to the exact material you need.
4. Track your batch progress with the Workflow Progress Tracker and toggle light/dark mode from the navigation bar for comfortable reading.
