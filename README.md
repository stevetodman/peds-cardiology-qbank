# Pediatric Cardiology QBank Prompt Pack

This project hosts a production-ready prompt pack for building a 5,000-item pediatric cardiology multiple-choice question bank. The site replaces the original quiz interface with a single-page reference hub that contains the workflow overview, copy-ready prompts, JSON schema, blueprint tables, reviewer packets, and quality checklists.

## Getting started

1. Open `index.html` in your browser to load the prompt pack experience.
2. Follow the "Quick Start Workflow" section on the page to see the recommended four-step process.
3. Use the sticky navigation, built-in section search (press `/`), or the new command palette (press `Ctrl+K` / `âŒ˜K`) to jump straight to sections, copy their content, or pin them for later.
4. Pin your highest-traffic panels so they appear inside the "Pinned Shortcuts" hub for one-click access whenever you return to the page.
5. Track your batch progress with the Workflow Progress Tracker and toggle light/dark mode from the navigation bar for comfortable reading.
6. Store reviewed JSON batches in the on-page JSON Batch Library, then export or re-import saved libraries to keep teams in sync across machines without any backend setup.
