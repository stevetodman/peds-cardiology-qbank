## üö® Critical Path to Launch

**Minimum to go live:**
1. ‚úÖ Working authentication
2. ‚úÖ Database schema
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è  At least 10 sample questions (ADD THIS)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è  Test the full quiz flow (DO THIS)
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è  Deploy to Vercel (READY TO DO)

## Quick Sample Data Script

Run this to add test questions quickly:

```sql
-- Insert sample question
INSERT INTO questions (question_text, explanation, subject, difficulty)
VALUES
  ('What is the most common congenital heart defect?',
   'Ventricular septal defect (VSD) accounts for approximately 30-40% of all congenital heart defects.',
   'Congenital Heart Disease',
   'Easy');

-- Get the question ID and add options
INSERT INTO question_options (question_id, option_text, is_correct)
VALUES
  (1, 'Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)', true),
  (1, 'Atrial Septal Defect (ASD)', false),
  (1, 'Tetralogy of Fallot', false),
  (1, 'Coarctation of the Aorta', false);

-- Add a flashcard
INSERT INTO flashcards (front_text, back_text, category)
VALUES
  ('What are the 4 components of Tetralogy of Fallot?',
   '1. VSD, 2. Pulmonary stenosis, 3. Overriding aorta, 4. Right ventricular hypertrophy',
   'Congenital Heart Disease');
```
