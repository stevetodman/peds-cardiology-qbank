# Project Status Report & Roadmap

## Executive Summary
- **Overall status:** Documentation is complete and the first working backend is now operational, serving quiz, scoring, and leaderboard APIs from the standard-library Python stack.
- **Highlights:** Comprehensive developer and user guides exist, the static prompt pack site ships with an npm-based asset pipeline, and the backend runs end-to-end without third-party dependencies.
- **Key focus for next phase:** Connect a dynamic frontend client to the API, expand content management tooling, and plan the migration path toward the long-term Django/React/PostgreSQL architecture.

## Completed Work
- Documented end-to-end functional and non-functional requirements for the gamified congenital heart disease learning platform in `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`.
- Produced a user-facing walkthrough in `USER_GUIDE.md` and a landing-page style prompt pack in `index.html`, `script.js`, and `styles.css`.
- Added a lightweight Node build pipeline (`build.js` and npm `build` script) to minify and package static assets into `dist/` for distribution.
- Delivered a self-contained Python backend (`backend/`) with JSON persistence, reusable service logic, and an HTTP API implemented via the standard library.
- Streamlined local execution with a `python backend/manage.py demo` workflow that seeds the database and launches the API in a single step.

## In Progress / Outstanding
- Integrate the static site (or a future React app) with the live API for quiz play, authentication, and progress dashboards.
- Add educator tooling for question imports, slide management, and multi-objective curriculum planning.
- Implement collaborative classroom features, richer analytics, and accessibility-focused UX polish.
- Layer automated testing, CI/CD automation, and deployment scripting on top of the new backend.

## Risks & Considerations
- **Scope breadth:** The platform spans content management, gamification, analytics, and classroom collaboration, so requirements may need prioritization to deliver an MVP within the estimated 2–4 month window.
- **Content volume:** Managing 500+ questions with rigorous metadata demands early tooling decisions (e.g., CSV imports, validation scripts) to prevent manual bottlenecks.
- **Integration complexity:** PowerPoint slide embedding, group session support, and leaderboard real-time updates require careful architectural planning.
- **Resource constraints:** A solo developer must balance feature development with QA, documentation, and deployment operations.

## Roadmap to Completion
| Phase | Duration (est.) | Goals | Key Deliverables |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 1 – Operational Prototype *(complete)* | Week 1 | Stand up documentation site and dependency-free backend with sample data. | Static site, npm build pipeline, standard-library backend with JSON store. |
| Phase 2 – Interactive Frontend | Weeks 2–3 | Build client-side quiz experience backed by the existing API. | UI for authentication, quiz play, progress dashboards, API adapters. |
| Phase 3 – Educator Tooling | Weeks 4–5 | Add question/slide import, objective authoring, and basic analytics exports. | Import scripts, admin endpoints, downloadable reports. |
| Phase 4 – Gamification Depth & Collaboration | Weeks 6–7 | Expand badges, leaderboards, and introduce classroom collaboration flows. | Group session APIs, enhanced leaderboard views, notification hooks. |
| Phase 5 – Enterprise Readiness | Weeks 8–9 | Introduce automated testing, accessibility audits, deployment automation, and plan migration to Django/React/PostgreSQL. | Test suites, CI/CD workflows, deployment scripts, migration roadmap. |

## Immediate Next Steps (Week 1 Checklist)
1. Wire the static site (or an interim vanilla JS client) to the HTTP API for listing objectives, running quizzes, and showing scores.
2. Capture automated smoke tests around `backend/manage.py check` and API endpoints to guard against regressions.
3. Begin designing the richer frontend (React or similar) that will eventually replace the static prompt pack.
4. Define issue tracker or project board to manage backlog aligned with the refreshed roadmap.

## Reporting Cadence
- Provide weekly status updates summarizing accomplishments, blockers, and planned tasks for the following week.
- Hold milestone reviews at the end of each roadmap phase to validate scope, adjust timelines, and capture lessons learned.
