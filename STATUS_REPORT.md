# Project Status Report & Roadmap

## Executive Summary
- **Overall status:** Planning and design documentation is complete, but the functional web platform has not yet been implemented.
- **Highlights:** Comprehensive developer and user guides exist, along with a simple static prompt pack site and a Node-based asset build script.
- **Key focus for next phase:** Stand up the Django backend, React frontend, and PostgreSQL database that power the gamified learning platform described in the developer guide.

## Completed Work
- Documented end-to-end functional and non-functional requirements for the gamified congenital heart disease learning platform in `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`.
- Produced a user-facing walkthrough in `USER_GUIDE.md` and a landing-page style prompt pack in `index.html`, `script.js`, and `styles.css`.
- Added a lightweight Node build pipeline (`build.js` and npm `build` script) to minify and package static assets into `dist/` for distribution.
- Bootstrapped a Django backend skeleton (`backend/`) with custom user, question, and gamification apps, REST API endpoints, and environment-aware settings.

## In Progress / Outstanding
- Harden backend endpoints with permission policies, pagination, and validation; implement content upload tooling and admin workflows.
- Frontend React application, routing, state management, and quiz experiences are not started.
- Content ingestion tooling (PowerPoint handling, bulk question import) and admin workflows remain to be implemented.
- Analytics, gamification logic, leaderboards, and collaborative classroom features are still conceptual only.
- Automated testing, CI/CD, accessibility compliance audits, and security hardening are pending.

## Risks & Considerations
- **Scope breadth:** The platform spans content management, gamification, analytics, and classroom collaboration, so requirements may need prioritization to deliver an MVP within the estimated 2–4 month window.
- **Content volume:** Managing 500+ questions with rigorous metadata demands early tooling decisions (e.g., CSV imports, validation scripts) to prevent manual bottlenecks.
- **Integration complexity:** PowerPoint slide embedding, group session support, and leaderboard real-time updates require careful architectural planning.
- **Resource constraints:** A solo developer must balance feature development with QA, documentation, and deployment operations.

## Roadmap to Completion
| Phase | Duration (est.) | Goals | Key Deliverables |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 1 – Project Bootstrap | Week 1 | Initialize Django project, configure PostgreSQL, scaffold React app, set up linting/testing frameworks. | Repository structure, environment configuration, CI skeleton. |
| Phase 2 – Core Backend APIs | Weeks 2–3 | Implement user accounts, learning objectives, questions, gamification models, and REST endpoints. | Django apps (`users`, `questions`, `gamification`), DRF serializers/views, migrations, unit tests. |
| Phase 3 – Frontend Foundation | Weeks 4–5 | Build React layout, authentication flow, dashboard, quiz runner, and API integration. | React components/pages, state management, styling system, frontend tests. |
| Phase 4 – Gamification & Analytics | Weeks 6–7 | Add points, badges, leaderboards, progress tracking, and admin analytics dashboards. | Gamification services, leaderboard APIs, analytics reports, data visualizations. |
| Phase 5 – Content Operations & Classroom Tools | Weeks 8–9 | Implement PowerPoint integration, group challenge mode, bulk content import, and admin moderation tools. | Slide ingestion workflows, collaborative session endpoints, admin UI enhancements. |
| Phase 6 – QA, Accessibility, & Deployment | Weeks 10–11 | Conduct accessibility and security reviews, finalize automated tests, prepare deployment pipelines, and launch beta. | WCAG audit fixes, security hardening, CI/CD pipelines, staging & production deployments, monitoring setup. |

## Immediate Next Steps (Week 1 Checklist)
1. Resolve package installation restrictions, install Python dependencies, and run initial Django migrations locally.
2. Configure CI-friendly environment variables and add automated checks for the new backend project scaffold.
3. Initialize React frontend (TypeScript) with routing, authentication guard scaffolds, and shared UI component library.
4. Define issue tracker or project board to manage backlog aligned with roadmap phases.

## Reporting Cadence
- Provide weekly status updates summarizing accomplishments, blockers, and planned tasks for the following week.
- Hold milestone reviews at the end of each roadmap phase to validate scope, adjust timelines, and capture lessons learned.
