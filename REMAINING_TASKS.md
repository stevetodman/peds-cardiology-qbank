## 🚨 CRITICAL - Must Complete Immediately

### 1. Fix QBank Categories Issue (USER ACTION REQUIRED)
**Status**: Solution created, needs user to execute
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Blocking QBank functionality
**Action**: User must run SQL in Supabase

**Steps:**
1. Log into Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Run the SQL from `add-categories.sql`:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO categories (name) VALUES
     ('Congenital Heart Disease'),
     ('Arrhythmias'),
     ('Heart Failure'),
     ('Acquired Heart Disease')
   ON CONFLICT (name) DO NOTHING;

   UPDATE questions
   SET category_id = (SELECT id FROM categories WHERE name = 'Congenital Heart Disease')
   WHERE category_id IS NULL;
   ```
4. Verify: Run `SELECT * FROM categories;` - should see 4 rows
5. Verify: Run `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM questions WHERE category_id IS NOT NULL;` - should see 3

**Expected Result**: "Start Practice" button in QBank will be enabled

**Files Created**:
- `add-categories.sql` - Quick fix script
